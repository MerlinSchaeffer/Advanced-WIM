In this lecture we introduce and examine Annette Lareau’s seminal concept of ‘concerted cultivation’.  How does this concept help explain differential outcomes for children and young people based on social class?  What is the evidence for the explanatory value of this theory and how has it been drawn on and adapted over time and for use in contexts outside the US.

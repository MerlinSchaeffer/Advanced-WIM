Why are even lazy upper-class kids oftentimes more successful than highly talented and motivated working class kids? In this session we will discuss a mechanism that helps us understand why upper class kids fare better, even the one's who're not that smart and motivated. With his idea of a compensatory advantage, Bernardi tried to give an explanation. Here we will discuss his idea and its application to inequality research.

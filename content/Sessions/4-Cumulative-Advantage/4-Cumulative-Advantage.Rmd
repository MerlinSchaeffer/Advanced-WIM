Cumulative advantage, that is, the idea that success breeds further success, is a prominent and promising social mechanism to explain inequality. However providing proof of cumulative advantage is more difficult than one might assume. In this session we discuss this fascinating mechanism and its potential applications. We also discuss a recent field experimental attempt to test this success-breeds-success mechanism.

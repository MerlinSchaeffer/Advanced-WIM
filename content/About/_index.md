This course is the first half of the introduction to advanced research on welfare, inequality, and (social) mobility. In this first half, I will put an emphasis on micro to meso theories that help us explain how inequality and stratification come about. Thus we will focus on analytical theories trying to specify mechanism that explain the processes that result in inequality. That is, we will discuss mechanisms that you can use as building blocks to develop arguments explaining how some form of inequality (e.g. the gender wage gap) comes about. We will not talk (so much) about conceptual theories that specify what inequality is, or how it has developed across the 20th and 21st century.

We will start micro with individual's skills and resources, work our way via families and networks, all up to the meso level of neighborhoods and organizations. In the second half of the course, Carsten Str√∏by Jensen will take it from the level of organizations all the way up to welfare states. In addition to theories, all participants need to give a presentation of a study testing the theories discussed in a specific week. Overall, the goal of this first part of the course is to give you a toolbox of social mechanisms that you can apply to explain all kinds of inequalities.

# Course structure
We meet twice a week, every Monday at 13pm and every Thursday at 8am. Every session lasts two hours and consists of a 15 minute lecture, 30 minutes group work (on how the theories discussed that day can be used to explain a specific form of inequality), a 15 minutes break, and finally two 15 minute presentations including questions afterwards. In the first session we will collectively decide on five to eight specific forms of inequality that we will theorize about throughout the class.

# Tasks
Overall, you have four tasks in this seminar: Thorough preparation of class readings, active participation in the seminar's discussions, a 10-15 minute presentation of an empirical study, and a 5-10 page essay. Below you find further information on each of these four tasks.

## Class Readings
Please prepare the class readings thoroughly along the line of the below-specified reading questions.

- *Theory*: What is the key social mechanism helping to explain what kind of inequality and how does it work?
- *Comparison to other theories*: How does the theory compare to other theories we have discussed in class? Is it complementary, in opposition, is it an extension?
- *Generalization*: Which phenomena could the proposed theory help to explain. Expecially think about the topics we cover in group work throughout the class.

## Two portfolios
1. Team up with another student and give a 10-15 minute presentation.
2. Write a 5-10 page essay (+50% per additional student) in which you compare the applicability and explanatory power of two inequality-generating mechanisms that we have discussed in class. If you are in groups, consider to discuss more than one mechanisms. Check out [Leaflet 5: Writing a Theory Essay](/uploads/Leaflet_5_Theory_Essay.pdf). Apply the two or more mechanisms to one of the phenomena we discuss in class. Make sure, the topic is not the on in which you present that week. You need to upload this essay to Peer Feedback on Absalon until 9 October. Then you need to give Peer Feedback to two fellow students until noon 12 October. Make sure to read your feedback before the final session.

## Presentation
Every student has to team up with another stuednt and give a presentation of an empirical study in one of the classes. The presentation shall take 10 to max. 15 minutes. You present a study that the other participants have not read. Your task is to present the study as if you were a scientific adviser to a political party, a foundation, or an NGO. Imagine you have read the new study and are convinced of its societal relevance. Now you have roughly ten minutes to convince the members of the board of your organization, none of whom has read the study, that this study is important and highly relevant for your organization's work. If you are successful, your research budget will be increased by the board, which means you gain freedom and advance in your career. This means your presentation needs to be pointed, easily understandable and convincing. Do not just summarize the empirical results, but show and interpret them for your audience. Importantly, explain how the study is an application of the theoretical idea we discuss that week. Try to use as much visualization and little text on your slides as possible. The other seminar participants mimic the imagined organization's board and ask critical questions after your presentation. Eventually, we will collectively give feedback on:

- Brief intro to topic and its relevance,
- Brief elaboration of core theoretical argument,
- Explanation of study design,
- Correct interpretation of results,
- Presentation style (timing, speed, pronunciation, etc.),
- Visualization (photos, graphics, etc.).

This course is the first half of the introduction to advanced research on welfare, inequality, and (social) mobility. In this first half, I will put an emphasis on micro to meso theories explaining inequality and stratification. We will start micro with individual's skills and resources, work our way via families and networks, to finally the neighborhood level. In the second half of the course, Carsten Str√∏by Jensen will take it to the level of organizations and welfare states. In addition to theories, we will often read studies testing these theories. Thus another focus will be the research designs these studies use. Overall, the goal of this first part of the course is to give you a toolbox of social mechanisms that you can apply to explain all kinds of inequalities.

# Course structure

We meet twice a week, every Monday at 13pm and every Thursday at 8am. Every session lasts two hours and consists of a 45 minute lecture with ample room for questions and comments from your side, a 15 minutes break, and a 45 minute session of discussions, group work and other forms of getting familiar with the materials.

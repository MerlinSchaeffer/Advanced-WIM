He is **[age]**. The doctor who examined **[name]**, assessed that he needs treatment.

# Reading questions

.push-left[
- *Theory*: What is the key inequality-generating mechanism proposed in this text?
- *Comparison to other theories*: How does the theory and the propopsed mechanism compare to others that we have already discussed in class, or which you know from other courses? Is it complementary, contradictory, is it an extension?
- *Generalization*: Which phenomena could the proposed inequality-genearating mechanism help to explain. Especially think about the topics we cover in group discussions throughout the course.

Your task is to present the study as if you were a scientific adviser to a political party, a foundation, or an NGO. Imagine you have read the new study and are convinced of its societal relevance. 

[...] 

your presentation needs to be pointed, easily understandable and convincing.

.push-right[
- Brief intro to topic and its relevance,

- Brief elaboration of core theoretical argument,

- Explanation of study design,

- Correct interpretation of results,

- Presentation style (timing, speed, pronunciation, etc.),

- Visualization (photos, graphics, etc.).

# General lessons .font70[I want to see you making an argument]

- TEXTFLOW! Texts are not chains of bullet points.

- The application and comparison are crucial. Here you show your skill as a sociologist.
  + You explanation needs to be linked not only to the outcome (e.g. wage), but also to the disadvantaged group (e.g. women)
  + Don't just repeat the theories, consider their implications for the phenomenon. 

- Focus on that part of a theory, which matters for your phenomenon.
  + "A study by Bird and Smith uses an example of a “collective action problem,” which can appear when members of a particular group have different interests and there may be conflict over who will pay the price for group-level signalling (Bird & Smith 2005: 235)."

# General lessons .font70[Be deligent with your text]

- Give factual evidence of the empirical extent of the phenomenon. 
  + How big is the gender wage gap? What are the chances to make it to the top if your parents were poor?
  
- You need to cite, if you make a factual claim about how the world works - unless you say: "I claim that ..."
  + "Social mobility is linked to inequality in the way that societies with high social inequality also have a rate of low social mobility."

- Chicago your paragraphs:
  + One idea one paragraph. Core idea is the first sentence. The rest of the paragraph elaborates the idea (argument, evidence, etc.)
  
- Theories are arguments, they don't show anything factual about the world.
